As we look to transition from Taiko Labs into the Taiko Foundation and Taiko DAO, we expect the line between full-time engineers and community builders to become even more blurry. \nIn conjunction with launching our grant program, we also seek to experiment with the grant framework itself. That can mean the duration, style, council/decision-making body, and much more is up for experimentation and iteration. For grants and all ecosystem incentive programs, we are driven by our desire to achieve the best outcomes for the Taiko network — how we get there and who leads the way is something we want to shape together with you and the community.Hence, this is only the start of what we hope will be a long and educational journey for our community. \nFor now, if you have ideas on grant frameworks, we’d like to have this conversation with you on our community forum. Please share your frameworks — as detailed or brief as you see fit — as responses to the <u>grant thread</u> on our community forum.",
